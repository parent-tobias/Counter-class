        Description:
      </h2>
      <p>So I wanted to work on the pomodoro timer for FCC, but I wanted to change a few things. First, I want to build it to be library-agnostic, as much as possible. Second, I want to use "modern" javascript, as in ECMAScript6, as much as possible (or
        where really feasible). Third, I wanted to make it more component based.</p>
      <p>To that third point, I really want to start building components that follow what I'm starting to see as the three rules: Encapsulation, Delegation and Communication. Here's how I view those:</p>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Encapsulation:</strong> Each component should be completely isolated from its siblings or ancestors.</li>
        <li><strong>Delegation:</strong> Each component should be able to delegate activities to its own descendants.</li>
        <li><strong>Communication:</strong> Each component should communicate with its ancestors.</li>
      </ul>
      <p>So here's the second of a few components: a Counter class.</p>

      Take a look at the <a href="./timer.js" target="_blank">timer source</a>, to see how it works!
    </div>
    <div id="counter1" class="counter"></div>

  </div>
  <div class="action-buttons">
    <button class='reset-btn'>
      Reset
    </button>
  </div>
  <script src="counter.js"></script>
  <script>
    // Create an instance of our Timer component. It is customizeable, and takes callbacks!
    let breakCounter = new Counter({
      title: "Break:",
      id: 'break',
      min: 0,
      max: 15,
      default: 5
    });
    let sessionCounter = new Counter({
      title: "Session:",
      id: 'session',
      min: 15,
      max: 60,
      default: 30,
      onChange: function(){
        console.log("You changed the session length. It is now "+sessionCounter.count+" minutes.");
      }
    });

    // Of course, we want to see it doing something. Let's get its dom node and put that in.
    let counterContainer = document.querySelector("#counter1");
    counterContainer.appendChild(breakCounter.domEl);
    counterContainer.appendChild(sessionCounter.domEl);
    
    // Let's create a reset!
    let resetBtn = document.querySelector('.reset-btn');
    resetBtn.addEventListener("click", function(){
      // The counter class has a reset function, which simply restores the display to
      //  the default value. Let's call that on both counters.
      breakCounter.reset();
      sessionCounter.reset();
    })
  </script>
